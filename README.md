# CSM-148-Data-Science
Data Science course was taken under the CS department at UCLA covering topics in machine learning, data analytics, and statistical modeling classically employed for prediction. The course was a blend of theoretical and practical instruction, with most of the work in this repository being practical. The course will seek to teach students the data science lifecycle: data selection and cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, and prediction methodologies.

Projects 1 & 2 contain coursework provided by Professor Sarrafzadeh, with additional code and modifications from me. Project 3 served as a final assignment, with all code belonging to me.
